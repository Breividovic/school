Simulation of doppler effect:
Spectator (user) is standing in the middle of long straight at a racing circuit. 
Racecar comes out from a turn with some initial velocity and starts accelerating with linear pace
until it passes the spectator and continues accelerating until the next turn.
This script simulates relativistic doppler effect from spectators frame. 
Resulting graph shows the relativistic frequency of the racecar that spectator hears as it accelerates along the straight.
